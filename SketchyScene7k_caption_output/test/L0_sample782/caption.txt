A realistic image of a small village with a clock tower, a church, a barn, a house, a person walking, a horse, a dog, a bird, a tree, and a cloudy sky. The scene should be set in a peaceful, rural environment with a mix of architectural styles and natural elements. The clock tower should be tall and prominently featured, while the church should have a steeple and a cross on top. The barn should be large and made of wood, with a silo and a haystack nearby. The house should be a two-story structure with a chimney and a garden in front. The person walking should be carrying a backpack, while the horse and dog should be positioned near the person. The bird should be perched on a branch, and the tree should have leaves and branches. The cloudy sky should be filled with wispy clouds, creating a serene atmosphere.
