A realistic image of a bus driving down a street with a house in the background, a clock on the side of the house, and a sun in the sky. The bus should have a large windshield, and the house should have a door and a window. The clock should be positioned on the side of the house, and the sun should be visible in the sky. The scene should be drawn in black and white, with the bus being the main focus.
